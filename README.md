# Video Encoder Optimization Project

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing video encoding efficiency through various advanced techniques, including Rate Control, Multi-pass Encoding, Parallelism, and Region of Interest (ROI) Encoding. The objective is to improve video quality while optimizing bitrate and processing time, making it suitable for various applications in digital video processing.

## Project Structure

The project consists of four main components, each focusing on different aspects of video encoding:

1. **Rate Control**: Implements a basic rate control algorithm that adjusts encoding parameters based on the Quantization Parameter (QP) values, enabling optimal bitrate allocation for I-frames and P-frames.

2. **Multi-pass Encoding**: Utilizes a two-pass encoding strategy to analyze video data and gather statistics in the first pass, followed by efficient encoding in the second pass. This approach enhances the overall perceptual quality of the video while managing computational complexity.

3. **Parallelism**: Explores different parallel processing strategies (block-level, frame-level) to maximize encoding throughput. The project evaluates the trade-offs between processing time and residual file size across various parallelism types.

4. **Region of Interest Encoding**: Focuses on enhancing the visual quality of key areas within a video by intelligently adjusting bitrate allocation. This technique is particularly effective in scenarios where specific regions (e.g., faces in surveillance footage) require higher quality.
